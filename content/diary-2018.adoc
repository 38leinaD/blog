=== Docker

Jenkins-user and user in docker have different UIDs and thus there are problems with permissions on mounted volumes.
Use `-u` flag to map container UID to host UID. More link:https://denibertovic.com/posts/handling-permissions-with-docker-volumes/[here].
In the end, this will still not work nicely with a lot of containers. Instead of mounting volumes I thus try to use `docker cp` to whenever I can.
It allows to copy and and out of containers but automatically set correct UIDs on host and container-side.
