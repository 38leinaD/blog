Say, you have defined an alias:

----
$ alias gg='git log --oneline --decorate --graph'
----

But when typing 'gg' wouldn't it be nice to expand the alias so you can make a small modification to the args?

----
$ gg<Ctrl+Alt+e>
----

Say, you want to easily clear the screen; there is a shortcut Ctrl+L. But maybe you also always want to print the contents of the current directory: you can rebind the shortcut:

----
$ bind -x '"\C-l": clear; ls -l'
