Say you just have cloned a massive github repository (like link:https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans[Netbeans]) where cloning already takes minutes and now decide to contribute.
You will fork the repo and than clone the fork and spend another X minutes waiting?

This sometimes seems like to much of an effort. And thankfully, there are steps how you can transform the already cloned repo to use your fork.


. Fork the repo
. Rename origin to upstream (your fork will be origin)

 git remote rename origin upstream

. Set origin as your fork

 git remote add origin git@github...my-fork

. Fetch origin

 git fetch origin

. Make master track new origin/master

 git checkout -B master --track origin/master
