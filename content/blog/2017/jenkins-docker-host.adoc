Say you want to run your Jenkins itself in docker. But the Jenkins build-jobs also uses docker!?

Either you have to install docker in docker, or you let the Jenkins docker-client access the host's docker-daemon.

. Map the unix socket into the Jenkins container:
+
----
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
----
. But the jenkins user will not have permissions to access the socket by default. So, first check the GID of the group that owns the socket:
+
----
getent group dockerroot
----
. Now create a group (name is irrelevant; lets name it "docker") in the Jenkins container with the same GID and assign the jenkins user to it:
+
----
sudo groupadd -g 982 docker
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
