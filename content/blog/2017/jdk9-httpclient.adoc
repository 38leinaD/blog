$ ./jdk-9_168/bin/jshell --add-modules jdk.incubator.httpclient
|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 9-ea

jshell> import jdk.incubator.http.*;

jshell> import static jdk.incubator.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandler.*;

jshell> URI uri = new URI("http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/");
uri ==> http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/

jshell> HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder(uri).build();
request ==> http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/ GET

jshell> HttpResponse response = HttpClient.newBuilder().build().send(request, discard(null));
response ==> jdk.incubator.http.HttpResponseImpl@133814f

jshell> response.statusCode();
$6 ==> 200
