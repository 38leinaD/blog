I am using Python a lot lately for machine learning.
To experiment a lot and quickly, I am using a simple shell-script that automatically runs my Python script whenever I change it.
This is not only useful for Python but for any task that should be triggered based on a changed file. 

[source, bash]

war() {
    war_do() {
        clear;
        the_time=$(date +%H:%M:%S)
        start=$(date +%s.%N)
        # Run the command that was provided as argument
        eval $@;
        rc=$?
        end=$(date +%s.%N)
        diff=$(echo "${end} - ${start}" | bc)
        if [ $rc -eq 0 ]; then
            echo ""
            echo -e "\e[2m[${the_time}]\e[0m \e[1;32m** Successful **\e[0m \e[2m(time: ${diff} seconds)\e[0m"
        else
            echo ""
            echo -e "\e[2m[${the_time}]\e[0m \e[1;31m** Failed **\e[0m"
        fi
        sleep 1;
    }
    war_do $@
    while inotifywait -qq .; do
        war_do $@
    done
}

You have to make sure that `inotifywait` is available on your system.
Assume you source the script in your .bashrc, you can now run below command to contiously run your Python script on each saved change:

----
war python app.py
----

Or your NodeJS script:

----
war node app.js
