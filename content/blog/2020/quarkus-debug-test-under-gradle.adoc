If you dive deeper into Quarkus and develop more serious applications it shows that Gradle is only the second consideration after Maven.
But it is unfair to make that argument because Quarkus also states that the Gradle-integrations is only in Preview.
Anyway, I sometimes struggle to find the correct configurations that work for Gradle.

One useful config to know is: How to enable remote-debugging for your `@QuarkusTest` and step through the test?

It seems, the Quarkus Gradle plugin collects `jvmArgs` from any existing `Test` task. That's why you can enable the debugger like this:

[source, groovy]
----
test {
    jvmArgs '-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005'
}
----
