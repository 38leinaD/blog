Deploy to e.g. Websphere liberty by adding this task to your `build.gradle` file:

[source, groovy]
----
task deployToWlp(type: Copy, dependsOn: 'war') {
    from war.archivePath
    into "${System.env.wlpProfileHome}/dropins"
}
----

Assuming you have the environment-variable set, you can now run `gradlew deployToWlp`.
