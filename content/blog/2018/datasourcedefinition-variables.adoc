In this post I would like to outline how to build a self-contained Java EE application (WAR), including JPA via custom JDBC-driver, but with zero application-server configuration/customizing.
The goal is to drop the Java EE application into a vanilla application-server. Zero configuration outside the WAR-archive.
I will be using the latest Java EE 8-compliant application-servers but that does not mean you cannot use a Java EE 7-compliant server.

To achieve our goal, I will be leveraging a feature of Java EE 7 that I always found interesting but did not use very often due to it's limitations: `@DatasourceDefinition`.
It is a way of declaring a datasource and connection-pool within your application via annotation; instead of having to configure it outside the application via non-portable configuration-scripts for the application-server of your choice.
E.g. on JBoss you would usually configure your datasource in the `standalone*.xml`; either directly or via a JBoss .cli-script.
Below you find an example how to define a datasource via annotation in a portable way:

[source, java]
----
@DataSourceDefinition(
        name = "java:app/jdbc/primary",
        className = "org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource",
        user = "postgres",
        password = "postgres",
        serverName = "localhost",
        portNumber = 5432,
        databaseName = "postgres")
----

To me, this was seldom useful because you hard-code your database-credentials. There has been a link:https://github.com/javaee/javaee-spec/blob/master/download/password-aliasing-ee7-proposal.pdf[proposal for Java EE 7] to support password-aliasing, but it never made it into the spec.
In the past, I only used it for small applications and proof-of-concepts.

Until now! A twitter-discussion lead me to realize that at least Wildfly and Payara come with vendor-specific features to do variable-replaments in the annotation-values.
But lets start from the beginning.



== Datasource-definition and JPA

Below you find a useful pattern to define and a produce a datasource within your application:

[source, java]
----
@Singleton
@DataSourceDefinition(
        name = "java:app/jdbc/primary",
        className = "org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource",
        user = "postgres",
        password = "postgres",
        serverName = "postgres",
        portNumber = 5432,
        databaseName = "postgres",
        minPoolSize = 10,
        maxPoolSize = 50)
public class DatasourceProducer {
	
	@Resource(lookup="java:app/jdbc/primary")
	DataSource ds;
	
	@Produces
	public DataSource getDatasource() {
		return ds;
	}	
}
----

The `@DatasourceDefinition` annotation is sufficient here to bind the datasource for PostgreSQL under the global JNDI-name `java:app/jdbc/primary`.

The usage of `@Resource` and `@Produces` is just additional code that exposes the datasource and makes it injectable in other managed beans via `@Inject Datasource ds`.
But for JPA, this is not needed. What we need is a `persistence.xml` that uses the same JNDI-name:

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<persistence 
    version="2.1" 
    xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence" 
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_1.xsd">
    <persistence-unit name="DefaultPU" transaction-type="JTA">
        <jta-data-source>java:app/jdbc/primary</jta-data-source>
        <exclude-unlisted-classes>false</exclude-unlisted-classes>
        <properties>
            <property name="javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action" value="drop-and-create" />
            <property name="javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.action" value="drop-and-create" />
            <property name="javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.create-target" value="schemaCreate.ddl" />
            <property name="javax.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.drop-target" value="schemaDrop.ddl" />

            <property name="eclipselink.logging.level.sql" value="FINE" />
            <property name="eclipselink.logging.level" value="FINE" />

            <property name="hibernate.show_sql" value="true" />
            <property name="hibernate.format_sql" value="true" />
        </properties>
    </persistence-unit>
</persistence>
----

From here on, it is plain JPA: Define some entity and inject the EntityManager via `@PersistenceContext EntityManager em;` to interact with JPA.

== Packaging of the JDBC-driver

You might have noticed that the `@DataSourceDefinition` references the JDBC-driver-class `org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource`.
Obviously, it has to be available for the application so it can connect to the database.
This can be achieved by placing the JDBC-driver in the application-server. E.g. under Wildfly, you register the JDBC-driver as a module.
But what we want is a self-contained application where the JDBC-driver is coming with the application.
This is very simple to achieve by adding a runtime-dependency to to the JDBC-driver. You favorite build-tool should support it.
In Gradle, it is done like this:

[source, groovy]
----
dependencies {
    providedCompile 'javax:javaee-api:8.0'
    runtime 'org.postgresql:postgresql:9.4.1212'
}
----

== Dynamic Configuration

What we have now is a self-contained Java EE application-archive (WAR) but the connection to the database and the credentials are hard-coded in the annotation-properties.
To make this really useful, we have to be able to overwrite this values for each stage and deployment. I.e. the database-credentials to the QA-environment's database will be different than for production.
Unfortunately, there is no portable/standard way. But if you are willing to commit to a specific application-server, it is possible.
A Twitter-discussion lead me to the documentation for Payara and Wildfly both supporting this feature in some way.

=== Payara

++++
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For Payara here is the Documentation: <a href="https://t.co/jQMOMVLy3N">https://t.co/jQMOMVLy3N</a><br><br>I think I saw something in Wildfly docs, but Iâ€™m not sure</p>&mdash; Felipe Moraes (@fe_amoraes) <a href="https://twitter.com/fe_amoraes/status/1006611447500046336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
++++

So, for Payara we find the documentation link:https://docs.payara.fish/documentation/payara-server/server-configuration/var-substitution/usage-of-variables.html[here].
Note that we will have to modify the annotation-values like this to read from environment variables:

[source, java]
----
@DataSourceDefinition(
        name = "java:app/jdbc/primary",
        className = "org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource",
        user = "${ENV=DB_USER}",
        password = "${ENV=DB_PASSWORD}",
        serverName = "${ENV=DB_SERVERNAME}",
        portNumber = 5432,
        databaseName = "${ENV=DB_DATABASENAME}",
        minPoolSize = 10,
        maxPoolSize = 50)
----


You can find this as a working Gradle-project plus Docker-Compose environment on link:https://github.com/38leinaD/jee-samples/tree/master/datasource-definition[Github].
The steps are very simple:

----
git clone https://github.com/38leinaD/jee-samples.git
cd jee-samples/datasource-definition/cars
./gradlew build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.payara.yml up
----

When the server is started, you can send below request to create a new row in the database:

----
curl -i -X POST -d '{"model": "tesla"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/cars/resources/cars
----

If you are wondering where the values like `${ENV=DB_USER}` are set, check the link:https://github.com/38leinaD/jee-samples/blob/master/datasource-definition/cars/docker-compose.payara.yml[docker-compose.payara.yml].

=== Widlfly

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For WildFly, see annotation-property-replacement here: <a href="https://t.co/UCGVlNVJkj">https://t.co/UCGVlNVJkj</a></p>&mdash; OmniFaces (@OmniFaces) <a href="https://twitter.com/OmniFaces/status/1006631897034829824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
++++

For Wildfly, you can find it under "Annotation Property Replacement" in the link:https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY/Subsystem+configuration[admin-guide].

First, we have to enable the variable-replacement feature in the `standalone*.xml`; which is not the case by default.

[source,xml]
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:ee:4.0">
    <annotation-property-replacement>true</annotation-property-replacement>
    <!-- ... -->
</subsystem>       
----

So, technically, we still hava to modify the application-server in the `standalone*.xml` in this case.

But then, you can use annotation-properties in the format `${<environment-variable>:<default-value>}`:

[source, java]
----
@DataSourceDefinition(
    name = "java:app/jdbc/primary",
    className = "org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource",
    user = "${DB_USER:postgres}",
    password = "${DB_PASSWORD:postgres}",
    serverName = "${DB_SERVERNAME:postgres}",
    portNumber = 5432,
    databaseName = "${DB_DATABASENAME:postgres}",
    minPoolSize = 10,
    maxPoolSize = 50)
----

If you try this, you will notice the following exception:

----
Caused by: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: FATAL: role "${DB_USER:postgres}" does not exist
	at org.postgresql.core.v3.QueryExecutorImpl.receiveErrorResponse(QueryExecutorImpl.java:2455)

	... 133 more
----

It seems there is a link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-10581[bug] in the latest Wildfly that does not allow to use variables for the user/password properties.
For now, we will continue with user and password beeing hardcoded and only the serverName and databaseName as dyanmic values:

[source, java]
----
@DataSourceDefinition(
    name = "java:app/jdbc/primary",
    className = "org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource",
    user = "postgres",
    password = "postgres",
    serverName = "${DB_SERVERNAME:postgres}",
    portNumber = 5432,
    databaseName = "${DB_DATABASENAME:postgres}",
    minPoolSize = 10,
    maxPoolSize = 50)
----

This works without any issues if the defaults match your environment. Explicitly overwriting these values can be achived via Java's system-properties. E.g `-DDB_SERVERNAME=postgres1` on the commandline.
See link:https://github.com/38leinaD/jee-samples/blob/master/datasource-definition/cars/docker-compose.wildfly.yml[docker-compose.wildfly.yml] for a complete example.
Before you can run this Wildfly-setup in the demo-application, you need to comment in the right annotation in link:https://github.com/38leinaD/jee-samples/blob/master/datasource-definition/cars/src/main/java/de/dplatz/cars/business/entity/DatasourceProducer.java[DatasourceProducer.java]. The default setup is for Payara.

=== Liberty

Liberty does not have support for variables yet, but there is interest and an link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/3963[issue] has been filed:

== Conclusion

If you make a choice for either Payara or Wildfly, you are able to build a truely self-contained Java EE application.
We have seen how to achive this for a WAR-archive leveraging JPA or plain JDBC. The JDBC-driver is contained within the WAR-archive and configuration for the datasources can be inject from the outside via environment variables or Java system-properties.

Payara and Wildfly offer slightly different mechanisms and syntax.
Payara shines because it does not require any additional application-server config.
But we cannot specify defaults in the annotation-values and always need to provide environment-variables from the outside.

Wildfly allows to set default-values on the annotation-properties. This makes it possible to deploy e.g. in a development-environment without the need to set any environment-variables.
A minor disadvantage is that the default configuration does not have the annotation-property-replacement enabled. So, the only vendor-specific config that is required is the enabling of this feature.
Also, currently this mechanism is riddled by a bug. Overwriting the user/password is not working currently.

With this, both application-servers offer a useful feature for cloud-native applications. Unfortunately, you have to decide for a specific application-server to leverage it.
But standardization-efforts are already on their way. The above discussion on Twitter has already been brought over to the link:https://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/jakarta.ee-community/msg00482.html[Jakarta EE mailing-list].
Feel free to join the discussion if you think this is a useful feature and should be standardized.
