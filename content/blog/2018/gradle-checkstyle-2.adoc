In link:/blog/2018/gradle-checkstyle.html[a previous post] I have described the minimal configuration to get checkstyle working with Gradle.
What i did not like, is that I have to place the `checkstyle.xml` in my project.
Assuming I stick with the standard checkstyle.xml from Google or Sun (or I have a corporate one), I do no want to place it in each and every repo.

What I found now is that Gradle supports referencing resources from within published artifacts.
In the below configuration, the `google_checks.xml` is referenced from the published artifact `com.puppycrawl.tools:checkstyle:8.10.1` directly.


[source, groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'checkstyle'

configurations {
    checkstyleConfig
}
def versions = [
    checkstyle: '8.10.1',
]
dependencies {
    checkstyleConfig ("com.puppycrawl.tools:checkstyle:${versions.checkstyle}") {
        transitive = false
    }
}
checkstyle {
    showViolations = true
    ignoreFailures = false
    toolVersion = "${versions.checkstyle}"
    config = resources.text.fromArchiveEntry(configurations.checkstyleConfig, 'google_checks.xml')
}
