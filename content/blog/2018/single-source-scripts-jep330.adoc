Java 11 includes link:http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/330[JEP 330] which allows to use Java source-files like  shell-scripts.

Create a file named `util` with the following content:

[source, java]
----
#!java --source 11

public class Util {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello " + args[0] + "!");
	}
}
----

Make sure it is executable by running `chmod u+x util`.

Running the script, will compile it on the fly:

----
> ./util Daniel
Hello Daniel!
----

As of now, editors like Visual Studio code don't recognize the file as Java files automatically. This means, code-completion and syntax hightlighting do not work without manual steps. Let's hope this gets fixed soon after the release of Java 11.
