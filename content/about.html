        <p>Hello, my name is <b>Daniel Platz</b>. I am a software engineer from Paderborn, Germany.</p>

        <p>I work as a consultant &amp; developer at <a href="http://www.dieboldnixdorf.com/">Diebold Nixdorf</a>. I am a big fan of Java (started with Java 1.4) and the Java EE ecosystem (since the J2EE days); working and solving business problems with it on a daily basis.
            Also Javascript has been a useful companion over the years; including frameworks like Angular and knockout.js. Nowadays, I prefer standards like ECMAScript >= 2015, CSS 3, HTML 5 and Webcomponents over the next shinny Javascript framework.
            I am most comfortable on a linux machine; and tools like zshell, Visual Studio Code and Eclipse help me to be productive.
            I have experience with application-servers like JBoss/Wildfly, Websphere (Traditional and Liberty) and Glassfish.
            Jenkins, Ant, Maven and Gradle have helped me for automation of any kind: builds, tests, deployments. You name it.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free-time, I also love coding; mainly Rust, Javascript and Java. If I am not doing techy stuff, I like to travel or be out in the nature; either by foot or cycling.<p/>
