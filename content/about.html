    <p>Hello, my name is <b>Daniel Platz</b>. I am a software developer living in Paderborn, Germany.</p>

    <p>
        I am a full-stack software developer with extensive experience in the retail-banking sector.
        I have been involved as developer, consultant and trainer in large projects all over the world;
        Australia, China, Mexico, UK and USA just to name a few.
        Over the years, I have been involved in all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC);
        from requirements gathering to setting up of production environments.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>

    <h3>Java & Java EE</h3>
    <p>
        I am a big fan of the Java ecosystem. I started with Java 1.4 and am a user of Java/Jakarta EE since the
        J2EE days and have developed numerous integrations between ATM applications and banking backends speaking
        Rest, SOAP, ISO 8583 and other propriatary protocols. Due to this, I have a lot of experience with
        technologies as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_RESTful_Web_Services" target="_blank">JAX-RS</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_XML_Web_Services" target="_blank">JAX-WS</a>,
        <a href="https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299" target="_blank">CDI</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Architecture_for_XML_Binding" target="_blank">JAXB</a>,
        <a href="https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=353" target="_blank">JSON-P</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API" target="_blank">JPA</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity" target="_blank">JDBC</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_JavaBeans" target="_blank">EJB</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Transaction_API" target="_blank">JTA</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_EE_Connector_Architecture" target="_blank">JCA</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Message_Service" target="_blank">JMS</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Faces" target="_blank">JSF</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_servlet" target="_blank">Servlets</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket" target="_blank">WebSockets</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_Validation" target="_blank">Bean Validation</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Groovy" target="_blank">Groovy</a>.

        Nowadays, I am a huge fan of <a href="https://quarkus.io/" target="_blank">Quarkus</a> because it brings a lot
        of joy and innovation to the Java ecosystem while still beeing able to reuse a lot of my knowledge on Java EE
        and <a href="https://microprofile.io/" target="_blank">MicroProfile</a>.

    </p>
    <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>
        Over the years, I also have gained a lot of experience with the following application-servers: <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WildFly" target="_blank">JBoss/Wildfly</a>, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_WebSphere_Application_Server" target="_blank">Websphere
            Traditional and Liberty</a>.

        Through side- and hobby-projects, I also have some experience with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlassFish" target="_blank">GlassFish</a>,
        <a href="http://www.payara.fish/" target="_blank">Payara</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_TomEE" target="_blank">TomEE</a> and
        <a href="https://quarkus.io/" target="_blank">Quarkus</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the database-side, I have mainly been working with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database" target="_blank">Oracle</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL" target="_blank">MySQL</a>

    </p>
    <h3>Web Technologies</h3>
    <p>
        For the front-end of ATM applications and various tools, I have worked with Web technologies as HTML,
        JavaScript and CSS.
        By this, I also gained experience with a lot of frameworks over the years (e.g.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_(web_framework)" target="_blank">Knockout</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)" target="_blank">Angular</a>) but nowadays I
        prefer the latest Web-standards like
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components" target="_blank">Web Components</a> over the next
        shinny JavaScript framework.

    </p>
    <h3>Tools</h3>
    <p>
        I am a fan of Eclipse and Visual Studio Code (mainly for frontend/web
        stuff) but I also enjoy beeing on the commandline (
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell" target="_blank">Z shell</a> with
        <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh" target="_blank">Oh My Zsh</a>)
        on my Linux system (mainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS" target="_blank">CentOS</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian" target="_blank">Debian</a>).

        I use the following technologies on a daily basis for automation of builds, tests and deployments:
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)" target="_blank">Docker</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git" target="_blank">Git</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradle" target="_blank">Gradle</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_(software)" target="_blank">Jenkins</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven" target="_blank">Maven</a>.

        I think writing documentation should leverage as much of the tooling and processes of software development
        as possible.
        That's why I am a huge fan of documenting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc"
            target="_blank">AsciiDoc</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlantUML"
            target="_blank">PlantUml</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Cloud</h3>
    <p>
        I am very excited about the possibilities offered by the cloud. All it needs is a good idea; the infrastructure
        and a lot of key services are only a few keystrokes away.
        Due to personal interest and what I have used in my professional job, I have most experience with <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services" target="_blank">AWS</a> and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure" target="_blank">Azure</a>.
        As of now, I also hold the following official certifications:
        <ul>
            <li>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</li>
        </ul>
