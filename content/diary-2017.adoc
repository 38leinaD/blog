.. You’re going to use sub-thread level concurrency
.. You want to use asynchronous I/O. If you can’t, at least isolate any synchronous I/O (JDBC) from the rest.
.. You don’t want to use distributed transactions, they’re fragile, they’re points of contention.
.. You don’t want to use an application server.

=== bintray

Finally singed up for bintray and published link:https://bintray.com/38leinad/maven/padersprinter-query[my first artifact]. Much nicer to use than sonatype.

* link:https://bintray.com/docs/usermanual/uploads/uploads_managinguploadedcontent.html#_gpg_signing[Internet says] there is a nice feature for "Signing with the Bintray Key" but i don't see to have that option.
** So, had to link:http://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html[generate] my own.
** To export my keys from gpg:

=== maven release plugin

First time doing a release, and thus github might no be in known_hosts, fails with this error:

----
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-release-plugin:2.5.2:prepare (default-cli) on project padersprinter-query: Unable to tag SCM
[ERROR] Provider message:
[ERROR] The git-push command failed.
[ERROR] Command output:
[ERROR] ssh_askpass: exec(/usr/sbin/ssh-askpass): No such file or directory
[ERROR] Host key verification failed.
[ERROR] fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
----

added to known_hosts by testing on command-line: `git ls-remote -h git@github.com:38leinaD/padersprinter-query.git HEAD`

So, release:prepare always tagged the SNAPSHOT version because no commit was happening before it. Seems to be a known issue; see link:[stackoverflow]. Tried a lot of version; the only combination that worked was this:

[source,xml]
----
<plugins>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-release-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.5.3</version>
        <configuration>
            <tagNameFormat>v@{project.version}</tagNameFormat>
        </configuration>
        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.scm</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-scm-provider-gitexe</artifactId>
                <version>1.8.1</version>

Also read the following articles on how to build/release with maven following CI/CD approach. Different but both interesting:

* link:https://axelfontaine.com/blog/final-nail.html[Releases with Maven and Git]
* link:http://java.jiderhamn.se/2016/05/04/announcing-maven-promote-plugin/[Maven Promote Plugin]
* link:https://dzone.com/articles/why-i-never-use-maven-release[Why I Never Use the Maven Release Plugin]

Using link:https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/jgit-flow/wiki/Home[gitflow plugin] for link:http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/[gitflow] see also like a handy plugin.
